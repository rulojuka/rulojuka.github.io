				<h2>Who I am</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Hi, my name is Alessandro Palmeira. I am a Computer Scientist that follows Software Engineering best practices and Agile principles to design, develop and deliver software with high product and code quality.</p>
			<p>I would like to work at Nubank because I feel I belong there. In my life, I seek the kind of challenges that Nubank would offer me to solve. Polish complex financial problems into well designed interfaces, removing bureaucracy and complexity out of the customer's way is the kind of problem I would like to face every day. Also, I love trying new things, and failing, and learning, and trying new things again until I succeed, and being around many people that live the same: young, bold, hungry for the next challenge.</p>
      <p>Finally, I want the highest of standards: to work on a company that is already the largest independent digital bank in the world and keep working to be even bigger.</p>
			<p>Some professional highlights related to this opening are:
				<ul>
					<li>As one of the most used programming languages at Nubank is Clojure, a functional language, I would like to point out that I <a href="https://github.com/ornicar/scalachess/pull/204">contributed</a> to lichess.org (a chess platform with tens of thousands of online users playing right now) using Scala, a functional language. I had never used Scala before, but I feel my deep understanding of programming languages fundamentals, functional programming and free software development helped a lot!</li>
					<li>I have written a card game software from scratch called SBKing. I coded all of the game rules, client/server communication, serialization, and client interface. Now it is part of a project in collaboration with the Brazilian Bridge Federation to teach 100 new players to play Bridge. The project is available at <a href="https://github.com/rulojuka/sbking">GitHub</a></li>
					<li>SBKing is open source and recently have other people collaborating, including an intern. So now I also work as the project maintainer and mentor, which demands excellent online communication and organization.</li>
					<li>I teach at Caelum (part of the Alura group), the lead IT School in Brazil. There, I have taught programming in different languages for more than 300 students since 2017. This experience made me familiar and comfortable with teaching, communicating in a team and speaking publicly.</li>
					<li>I value making the product delivery faster, more efficient and less error-prone using infrastructure automation. This also unburdens developers of doing repetitive work. For instance, I drove the implementation of Continuous Integration at the last company I worked by giving lectures, writing some Jenkins files, structuring the git workflow, structuring and writing tools to increase the quality of the automated tests suite and even writing a build monitoring bot to Discord.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>The full details are available in my <a href="https://linux.ime.usp.br/~rulojuka/cv.pdf">CV</a>. I am looking forward to hear from you!</p>
			<p>Kind Regards, <br/>
				Alessandro</p>
