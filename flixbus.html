				<h2>Who I am</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Hi, my name is Alessandro Wagner Palmeira. I am a Computer Scientist that follows Software Engineering best practices and Agile principles to design, develop and deliver software with high product and code quality.</p>
			<p>Although I live in Brazil, I already am an user of FlixBus :) I love to travel and I have a nice connection with Germany, so the last time I visited there, I took several FlixBuses and liked the service very much. Now I am looking for openings in Berlin and I figured FlixBus would be a nice place to work. From what I researched, I have a good cultural fit with the company and I also have a good fit with the opening so I would like very much if we could talk more about working together!</p>
			<p>Some professional highlights related to this opening are:
				<ul>
					<li>I teach Java (Object-Oriented programming and Web Programming) in the lead IT School in Brazil since 2017</li>
					<li>I have written a card game software from scratch in Java (called SBKing). I coded all of the game rules, client/server communication, serialization, and client interface. Now it is part of a project in collaboration with the Brazilian Bridge Federation to teach 100 new players to play Bridge. The project is available at <a href="https://github.com/rulojuka/sbking">GitHub</a></li>
					<li>SBKing is open source and recently have 2 other people collaborating. So now I also work as the project maintainer, which demands an excellent online communication and organization.</li>
					<li>I <a href="https://github.com/ornicar/scalachess/pull/204">contributed</a> to lichess.org using Scala. I had never used Scala before, but I feel my deep understanding of programming languages fundamentals, functional programming and free software development helped a lot!</li>
					<li>Recently a company hired me to create an assignment to test the skill level of its developers in some technical topics, including React and Redux. Part of the assignment is a simple Twitter clone (backend and frontend) written in Node.js/React, and its code is available at <a href="https://github.com/rulojuka/twtie-now">GitHub</a></li>
					<li>I have some experience with infrastructure enough to deploy SBKing in a docker container hosted in DigitalOcean. I also drove the implementation of Continuous Integration at the last company I worked. There I wrote some Jenkins files, structured the git workflow, structured and wrote tools to increase the quality of the automated tests suite and wrote a Discord build monitoring bot.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>The full details are available in my <a href="https://linux.ime.usp.br/~rulojuka/cv.pdf">CV</a>. I am looking forward to hear from you!</p>
			<p>Kind Regards, <br/>
				Alessandro</p>
